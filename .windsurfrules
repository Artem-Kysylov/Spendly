# PROJECT CONTEXT & TECH STACK
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- UI: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Lucide React
- Deployment: Vercel (PWA enabled)

# CRITICAL RULES (THE "SURGEON" MINDSET)
1. **Minimal Changes:** Do NOT rewrite entire files. Only modify the specific lines needed for the task.
2. **Preserve Logic:** Never remove existing error handling, logging, or edge-case checks unless explicitly asked.
3. **No Placeholders:** Never leave comments like "// ...rest of code". Always output the full functional block if you touch it.
4. **Mobile First:** All UI changes must be verified for mobile responsiveness (iPhone SE/XR sizes).

# LOCALIZATION PROTOCOL (STRICT)
We support 7 languages. When adding or changing ANY text in the UI:
1. You MUST update the JSON files for ALL 7 locales simultaneously:
   - `messages/en.json` (Source)
   - `messages/ru.json`
   - `messages/uk.json`
   - `messages/ja.json`
   - `messages/id.json`
   - `messages/hi.json`
   - `messages/ko.json`
2. Ensure keys match exactly across all files.
3. Keep the translation tone: Friendly, concise, financial app context.

# DATABASE & SUPABASE
- Always assume RLS (Row Level Security) is on.
- When creating tables, always include `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- Use snake_case for DB columns and camelCase for TypeScript variables.

# CODING STYLE
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data models.
- Prefer functional components with Hooks.
- Don't use `any`. Define proper types.
